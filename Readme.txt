Background Game Profile Switcher (BGPS)

Summary
-------
BGPS is a utility to enable game controller profile switching to be done either automatically or manually upon pressing a game controller button or keyboard key. The primary use case for this utility is to provide methods of switching game controller profiles from within a VR environment where there is no conventional front-end with run-before, run-after type functionality to run game-specific external scripts.

Installation
------------
BGPS is a compiled AHK (AutoHotKey) application that needs no special installation. Just extract the distribution zip file to a folder on your Windows computer that has read/write access. When you run the executable (BGPS.exe), you will see a joystick icon in the Windows tray.  Right-click on this and select the "Settings..." option to configure. 

Configuration
